Hi there,

In this guide, I will walk you through how to use a sample dataset to build a dashboard and extract insights using the AI/BI dashboard UI on Azure Databricks

## Prerequisites

•	You are logged into a Azure Databricks workspace.
•	You have the SQL entitlement in that workspace.
•	You have at least CAN USE access to one or more SQL warehouses.

## How-to Guide

**Step 1. Create a dashboard**

1.	In your Azure Databricks workspace, click on Dashboard, then click Create Dashboard.
2.	By default, the new dashboard is automatically named using its creation timestamp and stored in your /Workspace/Users/<username> directory.
3.	Rename the dashboard and the page as needed.
4.	Use the Canvas tab to create and edit widgets such as visualizations, text boxes, and filters.
5.	Use the Data tab to define the underlying datasets for your dashboard.

**Step 2. Define datasets**

1.	Click the Data tab.
2.	Click Create from SQL
3.	Paste the following query into the editor. Then click Run to return a collection of records.

```sql
SELECT
  T.tpep_pickup_datetime,
  T.tpep_dropoff_datetime,
  T.fare_amount,
  T.pickup_zip,
  T.dropoff_zip,
  T.trip_distance,
  T.weekday,
  CASE
    WHEN T.weekday = 1 THEN 'Sunday'
    WHEN T.weekday = 2 THEN 'Monday'
    WHEN T.weekday = 3 THEN 'Tuesday'
    WHEN T.weekday = 4 THEN 'Wednesday'
    WHEN T.weekday = 5 THEN 'Thursday'
    WHEN T.weekday = 6 THEN 'Friday'
    WHEN T.weekday = 7 THEN 'Saturday'
    ELSE 'N/A'
  END AS day_of_week
FROM
(
  SELECT
    dayofweek(tpep_pickup_datetime) as weekday,
    *
  FROM
    `samples`.nyctaxi.trips
  WHERE
    trip_distance > 0
    AND trip_distance < 10
    AND fare_amount > 0
    AND fare_amount < 50
) T
ORDER BY
  T.weekday
```
