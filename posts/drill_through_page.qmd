Hello! 

In this post, I will introduce how to enhance Power BI reports by using drill-through fields to filter detailed reports, providing deeper insights. Additionally, I will demonstrate how to visualize changes over time using the Play Axis feature, which offers engaging and dynamic data insights.

## Use-case description
Our dataset is a sample financial dataset in Power BI Desktop. Our goal is to create a report on the expenditures of Wake County Watchdog, with a focus on the fiscal year 2019.
The report consists of two pages:

**General Report (Page 1)**

This page provides an overview of expenditures across different funds and departments. It addresses the following questions:

- What is the comparison between Actual Amount and Budgeted Amount by Fund Name?
- Which departments exceeded their budget, and which did not?
- What is the total amount over budget?

**Detailed Drill-through Report (Page 2)**

This page focuses on detailed expenditure reports for a selected department, allowing exploration by sub-categories based on the hierarchy: Department -> Division -> Cost Center. It answers questions such as:

- How is expenditure distributed by department, division, and cost center over time?
- How does the amount over budget change over time by cost center?

## Development Process
Our development process follows these key steps:

### Data Loading
- Import the sample financial dataset into Power BI Desktop.

### Data Modeling
- Create and verify the hierarchy (Department -> Division -> Cost Center).
- Develop DAX formulas to calculate key measures:
    - Amount Over Budget = SUM(Expenditures[Actual Amount]) - SUM(Expenditures[Budgeted Amount])
    - Is Over Budget = (SUM(Expenditures[Actual Amount]) - SUM(Expenditures[Budgeted Amount])) > 0
    - Number of Expenditures = COUNT(Expenditures[Check Number])

### Report Building

**Page 1: General Report**

- Add a title.
- Visual #1: Clustered bar chart showing Actual Amount and Budgeted Amount by Fund Name.
- Visual #2: Table listing departments over/under budget.
- Visual #3: Card visual displaying the total amount over budget.
- Apply a filter to display data for fiscal year 2019.
- Add lines to separate sections of the report.

**Page 2: Drill-through Detailed Report**

- Add a title.
- Visual #4: Line chart showing Actual Amount over time.
- Visual #5: Treemap visualizing Actual Amount by Division and Cost Center. Add a drill-through dimension to this page.
- Visual #6: Scatter chart with a Play Axis to visualize Expenditures by Cost Center over time (Year and Month).

### Report Publishing

- Publish the report from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI Service for sharing and collaboration.

To practice this use case hands-on, follow my step-by-step tutorial video to complete the outlined steps.

## Final result

The resulting report on Wake County Watchdogâ€™s expenditures will contain two pages. 

The first page Over Budget should be like this:
<center><img src="/images/drill_through_page/page1.png"></center>	

The drill-through page will be accessible through a selected dimension from the first page.

To give you a hands-on practice of this use case, please following my step-by-step tutorial video to perform all the above steps:

**Key Insights for Executives:**

- Total Expenditure Over Budget (Fiscal Year 2019): **$108.36M**
- Actual Expenditure for Fire 800MHZ on September 4, 2018: **$126,578**
- Number of Over-Budget Expenditures for Facilities Design and Construction (November 2018): **41**
