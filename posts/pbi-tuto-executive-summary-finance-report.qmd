**Welcome to Business Intelligence world with Power BI!**

In this post, I will guide you through building an executive summary finance report using Power BI.

## Use Case Description

- Our dataset is a sample financical dataset from Power BI Desktop
- Our objective is to create a Power BI report that helps executives answer the following three questions:
	- Which month and year had the highest profit?
	- Where is the company experiencing the most success (by country/region)?
	- Which product and segment should the company continue investing in?

## How-to Guide
Our development process involves the following steps:

**- Data preparation** 
	- Data loading
	- Data transformation
		- Convert the data type of "Units Sold" to Whole Number.
		- Change the ext format of "Segment" to UPPERCASE.
		- Rename "Month Name" to "Month".
		- Remove the "Montana" product from "Product" as it was discontinued last month.
**- Data modeling**
	- Write two DAX formulas for *measures* and *tables*
**- Report building**
	- Visual #1: Add a title
	- Visual #2: Line graph for Profit by Date
	- Visual #3: Map visualisation for Profit by Country/Region
	- Visual #4: Bar graph for Sales by Product and Segment
	- Visual #5: Time slider for Year 
**- Report Publishing**
- Publish our report from Power BI Desktop to Power BI service to share
