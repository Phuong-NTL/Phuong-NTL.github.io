Welcome to Business Intelligence world with Power BI!

In this post I will walk you through how to build an executive summary - finance report with Power BI.

## Use-case description

- Our dataset is a sample Financical dataset of Power BI Desktop
- Our objective is to build a Power BI report that help the executives to answer the three following questions:
	- Which month and year had the most profit?
	- Where is the company seeing the most success (by country/region)?
	- Which product and segment should the company continue to invest in?

## How-to guide
Our development process involves the following steps:

- Data preparation 
	- Data loading
	- Data transformation
		- Convert data type of "Units Sold" to Whole Number
		- Change text format of "Segment" to UPPERCASE
		- Rename "Month Name" to "Month"
		- Drop "Montana" product from "Product" as we know that the Montana product was discontinued last month.
- Data modeling
	- Write two DAX formulas for *measures* and *tables*
- Build report
	- Visual #1: Add a title
	- Visual #2: Line graph for Profit by Date
	- Visual #3: Map graph for Profit by Country/Region
	- Visual #4: Bar graph for Sales by Product and Segment
	- Visual #5: Time slider for Year 
- Publish our report from Power BI Desktop to Power BI service to share
