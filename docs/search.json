Our goal is to create a report on the expenditures of Wake County Watchdog, with a focus on the fiscal year 2019. The report consists of two pages:\nGeneral Report (Page 1)\nThis page provides an overview of expenditures across different funds and departments. It addresses the following questions:\n\nWhat is the comparison between Actual Amount and Budgeted Amount by Fund Name?\nWhich departments exceeded their budget, and which did not?\nWhat is the total amount over budget?\n\nDetailed Drill-through Report (Page 2)\nThis page focuses on detailed expenditure reports for a selected department, allowing exploration by sub-categories based on the hierarchy: Department -&gt; Division -&gt; Cost Center. It answers questions such as:\n\nHow is expenditure distributed by department, division, and cost center over time?\nHow does the amount over budget change over time by cost center?",
